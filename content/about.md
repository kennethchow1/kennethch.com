My name is Kenneth Chow, I am a Tech Enthusiast with strong passion for Linux, Cloud Infrastructure, Cybersecurity and big advocate of Internet Privacy. I love tinkering and learning about new open source applications through Github and working in the Linux Terminal in the Cloud, on a virtual machine or at home.
